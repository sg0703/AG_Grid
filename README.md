# AG Grid Practice

## Description

I created this simple app to practice with AG Grid. I used FinnHub.io's forex API. The page displays current forex rates for the US dollar on one grid.

The app queries FinnHub to determine which exchanges are currently available and populates a dropdown menu. When users select an exchange and click "search", the second grid is populated with forex symbols and information about those symbols.
